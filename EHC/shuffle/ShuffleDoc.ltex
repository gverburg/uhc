|Shuffle| takes as input files containing versions of chunks of (sourcecode) text, producing
a merged piece of text for a particular version.

\section{Overview and command line invocation}

When invoked by \verb'shuffle --help', |Shuffle| will answer with

\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --help%%>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Version generation}

|Shuffle| takes a chunked source file and produces on stdout the version specified by
\verb'--gen=version'.
Output can be generated in 3 different variants, for further processing by
Haskell compilers (\verb'--hs'), for the AG system (\verb'--ag') and LaTeX (\verb'--latex').
The produced output is assumed to be processed by |lhs2tex| [cite] first, unless the option
\verb'--lhs2tex=no' is specified.

For example the input

\begin{verbatim}
%%<cat shuffle/test/tst2%%>
\end{verbatim}

gives the following variants when invoked with different parameters.

\begin{itemize}

\item
\verb'shuffle --gen=2 --ag shuffle/test/tst2'.
Generate for version 2, AG system, to be processed first by |lhs2tex|.
\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --gen=2 --ag shuffle/test/tst2%%>
\end{verbatim}


\item
\verb'shuffle --gen=1 --hs --lhs2tex=no --base=Main shuffle/test/tst2'.
Generate for version 1, Haskell, with name of module specified (instead of derived from the filename),
not to be processed by |lhs2tex|.
\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --gen=1 --hs --lhs2tex=no --base=Main shuffle/test/tst2%%>
\end{verbatim}

\item
\verb'shuffle --gen=2 --latex shuffle/test/tst2'.
Generate for version 2, LaTeX, to be processed first by |lhs2tex|.
Text is wrapped inside macros for definition (\verb'\chunkCmdDef') and use (\verb'\chunkCmdUse')
of a chunk, to be defined by the user.
\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --gen=2 --latex shuffle/test/tst2%%>
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

For now combinations of output nor multiple files are allowed.

\subsection{Remaining options}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Generation of index entries is turned on by the option @--index@.
An index entry complying to @makeindex@ syntax is passed to the \LaTeX\ command @\chunkIndex@.
Words to be indexed are guessed based on AG and Haskell semantics but is crude in its approximation.
A file with a blank separated list of strings not to be indexed can be passed via the option @--xref-except@.
In the future all of this may be changed to allow for more fine-grained control or be removed because too
many useless entries are created.
\end{itemize}

\section{Input format}
Chunks are defined by text of the following structure
\begin{verbatim}
%%[<chunkName> <parameters>
<text>
%%]
\end{verbatim}
The delimiters \verb'%%[' and \verb'%%]' must start at the beginning of a new line.
Chunk definitions may
not be nested.
Text between chunk definitions is ignored.
The \verb'<text>' of a chunk may be empty.

A |chunkName| can either be an integer for versioned chunks or an alphanumerical identifier for
named chunks.

\subsection{Named chunks}
A named chunk is defined by
\begin{verbatim}
%%[<alphaNumId>
<text>
%%]
\end{verbatim}
and can be referred to from inside a chunk by
\begin{verbatim}
%%@<alphaNumId>
\end{verbatim}
A reference is replaced in the output by its corresponding definition.
For example, the following input
\begin{verbatim}
%%<cat shuffle/test/tst3%%>
\end{verbatim}
will give (for \verb'shuffle --gen=1 --ag --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst3')
\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --gen=1 --ag --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst3%%>
\end{verbatim}
Named chunks on their own do not produce output, only when referred to from a versioned chunk.


\subsection{Versioned chunks}
A versioned chunk is defined by
\begin{verbatim}
%%[<versionId> [.<nameId>] [-(<chunkId>*)] [hs] [module <id>] [import(<id>*)] [export(<id>*)]
<text>
%%]
\end{verbatim}

An |versionId| can be $0$ or a nonempty sequence of positive integers separated
by an underscore character '@_@'.
From within \LaTeX\ a dot '.' instead is used
(because underscore would be inconvenient as it
is already special for \LaTeX).
The underscore specifies a nested version.
The ordering between integers is used to provide for a default
ordering of versions, for nesting the usual lexical ordering
is used.

Version $0$ is special in that it defines text to be always inserted in the output
without any additional treatment.
For example, this can be used to incorporate a |lhs2tex| preamble.

The combination of |versionId| and |nameId| is called a |chunkId|, syntactically composed of
the two components by a dot \verb|'.'| in between.
For a chunk it is not necessary to specify a full |chunkId|, a |versionId| suffices to make it be
included in the output for the version.
If a full |chunkId| is specified
\begin{itemize}
\item
its content can be referred to from within \LaTeX\ by
\begin{verbatim}
\chunkCmdUse{<filename>.<chunkId>}
\end{verbatim}
\item
it can be removed by a later version referring to it by |- chunkId|.
\end{itemize}

The order in which chunks appear in the input file is preserved, except for \LaTeX\ generation
(with option @--latex@) for which this is not guaranteed.

\subsubsection{Chunk removal}
A versioned chunk can be inhibited to produce output by a later version
from within that later version by |- chunkId|.
For example
\begin{verbatim}
%%<cat shuffle/test/tst4%%>
\end{verbatim}
will give (for \verb'shuffle --gen=3 --ag --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst4')
\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --gen=3 --ag --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst4%%>
\end{verbatim}
Note that only the chunk referred to is not included.
Multiple chunks can be removed this way by specifying a (parenthesized, white separated) list of |chunkId|'s.

\subsubsection{Chunk ordering}
When combined and printed to output an ordering is used.
The default ordering on versions is used to define which chunks should be printed
on output.
For example, if chunk |3| is requested and |1,2,3,4| are available only the
chunks for |1,2,3| will produce output in that order.
Nested chunks do not produce output.

A more specific ordering, including nested versions, can be specified with the
option @--order@. An ordering consists of a comma separated list
of orders, where each order is a @'<'@ separated list of versions.
The ordering specifies a graph which is used to determine which versions have a path
(defined by the @'<'@)
to the version for which output generation takes place.
For example,
\begin{verbatim}
1 < 2 < 3, 2 < 2_1
\end{verbatim}
specifies the usual order for non-nested versions and an additional branch @2_1@ which
is based upon version @2@. When generation is asked for @3@, text for |1, 2, 3| is included
but not for @2_1@ and vice-versa
if generation is requested for @2_1@.
If instead
\begin{verbatim}
1 < 2 < 3, 2 < 2_1 < 3
\end{verbatim}
would have been specified all available chunks, including @2_1@ and @3@ would be included for
both @--gen=3@ and @--gen=2_1@.
Chunks with versions not included in the ordering are non-existent as far as generation of output
is concerned.

\subsubsection{Output specific behavior}
The remaining optional parameters of a chunk definition only have meaning dependent on
the output format chosen.
For example
\begin{verbatim}
%%<cat shuffle/test/tst5%%>
\end{verbatim}
will give 
\begin{itemize}
\item for \verb'shuffle --gen=1 --ag --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst5'
\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --gen=1 --ag --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst5%%>
\end{verbatim}

\item for \verb'shuffle --gen=1 --hs --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst5'
\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --gen=1 --hs --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst5%%>
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

To allow for incorporating Haskell inside AG the parameter \verb'hs' is specified, for example in
\begin{verbatim}
%%<cat shuffle/test/tst6%%>
\end{verbatim}
will give (for \verb'shuffle --gen=1 --ag --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst6')
\begin{verbatim}
%%<bin/shuffle --gen=1 --ag --lhs2tex=no shuffle/test/tst6%%>
\end{verbatim}

Currently, none of this specific behavior is implemented for \LaTeX\ output.
Generation for \LaTeX\ also ignores the @--gen@ flag by
behaving as if @--gen=all@ were specified.

\subsection{Interaction with \LaTeX}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Required macro's:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\chunkCmdDef}[1]{\expandafter\def\csname #1\endcsname}
\newcommand{\chunkMetaDef}[1]{\expandafter\def\csname #1\endcsname}
\newcommand{\chunkCmdUse}[1]{\csname #1\endcsname}
\newcommand{\chunkIndex}[1]{\index{#1}}
\end{verbatim}

\item
Each chunk has also a label defined, with the same name as the chunk name.
\end{itemize}
