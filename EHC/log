-EHAbsSyn 
  * added QualTyExpr and PredExpr
-EHTyInfer
  * added Rec, emptyRow, rowexts to tyGam
  * added row kind
-EHPretty
  * added rules for pretty printing QualTyExprs
-EHInferExpr
  * added rules to infer type of QualTyExpr
-EHTy.cag
  * added row extension constants
-EHTyCommonAG.cag
  * added appSpinePos inh attr to Pred
-EHTyPretty
  * added pretty printing Preds and QualTys
-EHTyQuantify
  * make sure quantification takes into account type variables in predicates
-EHCnstr
  * instances for QualTy and Pred for free type variables and substitution
-EHCommon
  * added built in names for record extension, row kind etc.
-EHParser
  * added parser for QualTyExprs -- not infallible!
-EHTyFitsIn
  * added subsumption for rows

! EHTyFitsIn
! need to define local attr @labels properly
! may need to adapt EHTy.cag - i.e. arrow destruction etc.
! parser for QualTyExpr

points to discuss with Atze:
  * Missing predicates!
  * quantification
  * generation of fresh identifiers for rec ext vals in initial gamma
  * EHTyFitsIn
