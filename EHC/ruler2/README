Requirements
------------

GHC 6.4     : http://www.haskell.org/ghc
UUST library: see http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/Ehc/WebHome


Installation
------------

From withing the directory where this README lives:

to make ../bin/ruler2  :  make ruler
to make the demo       :  make demo
to try the demo        :  DEMOEXEC < demo/tst5

to find out the exact names of the executables (like DEMOEXEC above)
                       :  make

An older (not included) version of the Ruler system is named 'ruler',
it will become obsolete in the near future so the name ruler2 will change into ruler.
