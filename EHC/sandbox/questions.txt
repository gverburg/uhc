Questions

1. When rules are used to generate AG files, certain
   information is thrown out; in particular, the target
   node.  However, we will need to preserve nodes when
   generating our Haskell code (that processes more than
   one node at a time).  Que Pasa?

2. When we need to pattern match on constructors we need 
   to know parameters of the constructor. But the constructor is now simply given
   as a string, so we will have to find the arity ourselfs. 

3. Should we be thinking about generating Haskell that
   will then invoke semantic AG functions or just pure
   Haskell?
